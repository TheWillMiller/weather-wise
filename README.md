**Latest release:** `v0.8.2`

RadarWise is a Home Assistant dashboard (Lovelace) custom card for current weather, hourly and daily forecasts, precipitation details, sunrise and sunset, wind, humidity, dew point, UV index, optional AQI/pollen, and optional radar. It follows the TideWise/RiverWise visual language while staying a dashboard card, not a backend integration.

> **Public release note:** RadarWise is ready for regular use, but weather providers vary by region. Please report provider-specific layout, radar, or forecast quirks so support can keep improving.

## Region Support

RadarWise gets weather data from an existing Home Assistant `weather` entity, so it can work anywhere Home Assistant has a weather provider.

| Region | Weather data | Radar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| United States | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | NOAA radar by default, RainViewer optional |
| Canada | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | Environment Canada radar by default, RainViewer optional |
| United Kingdom | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | RainViewer global radar by default |
| Global / other | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | RainViewer global radar by default |

RadarWise does not ask for, store, or call private weather API keys from dashboard YAML.

Environment Canada radar uses the public MSC GeoMet `RADAR_1KM_RRAI` WMS layer. RainViewer is still available as a no-key global radar option. Its public API is for personal, educational, and small community use and may have service or coverage limits.

### Testing Outside the US, Canada, and UK

RadarWise should still render current conditions and forecasts anywhere Home Assistant has a working `weather` entity. Outside the initial US, Canada, and UK presets, radar falls back to RainViewer and local alert/warning overlays may be limited or unavailable.

If you are testing from Australia, New Zealand, Europe, or any other region, please open a report or feature request with:

- Country/region and nearest city or general area
- Home Assistant weather integration/provider
- Whether hourly and daily forecasts appear
- Whether RainViewer radar loads for your area
- Any local radar, warning, or forecast provider RadarWise should know about

## Installation

### Recommended: HACS Custom Repository

[![Open RadarWise in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=TheWillMiller&repository=radar-wise&category=plugin)

RadarWise is not yet listed in the default/searchable HACS store. Until it is accepted into the default HACS list, install it as a custom HACS repository.

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Open the three-dot menu in the top right.
3. Choose **Custom repositories**.
4. Add this repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/TheWillMiller/radar-wise
```

5. For category, choose **Dashboard**.
6. Install **RadarWise**.
7. Refresh Home Assistant.

A hard browser refresh is recommended after installing or updating:

- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

Then add the card from your dashboard editor:

1. Edit your dashboard.
2. Add a new card.
3. Search for **RadarWise**.
4. Open the visual editor.
5. Choose a weather entity.
6. Choose the region/radar setup.
7. Save.

### Manual Install

1. Download or copy `radarwise-card.js`.
2. Place it in your Home Assistant `www` directory.
3. Add it as a dashboard resource:

```yaml
url: /local/radarwise-card.js
type: module
```

4. Refresh Home Assistant and hard-refresh your browser.
5. Add the card to a dashboard.

### Rename Compatibility

RadarWise was renamed from its original project name in `v0.5.0`. If Home Assistant still has an older resource URL that points to `weatherwise-card.js`, `v0.5.1` and later include a compatibility loader at that filename so the card can still register. New installs should use `radarwise-card.js`.

### Test From GitHub CDN

For quick testing before installing locally, you can add this dashboard resource:

```yaml
url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheWillMiller/radar-wise@v0.8.2/radarwise-card.js
type: module
```

CDN testing is not the preferred long-term install method. HACS is recommended for normal use.

## Quick Start

```yaml
type: custom:radarwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: us
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: radarwise
units: auto
layout: auto
forecast_count: 5
hourly_count: 5
latitude: 33.688
longitude: -78.886
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## Canada Example

```yaml
type: custom:radarwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: ca
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: radarwise
units: metric
latitude: 43.6532
longitude: -79.3832
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## UK Example

```yaml
type: custom:radarwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: uk
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: auto
units: metric
latitude: 51.5072
longitude: -0.1276
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## Open-Meteo AQI/UV/Pollen Example

```yaml
type: custom:radarwise-card
entity: weather.home
environment_source: open_meteo
show_environment: true
latitude: 33.688
longitude: -78.886
```

Open-Meteo mode requests AQI, UV index, and pollen for the configured latitude/longitude and does not need an API key. Use `environment_source: sensors` to keep AQI, UV index, and pollen fully entity-driven inside Home Assistant, or `environment_source: disabled` to hide the environment cluster.

## Theme Support

RadarWise defaults to its built-in glass styling:

```yaml
theme_mode: radarwise
```

To make the card follow Home Assistant theme colors more closely, use:

```yaml
theme_mode: auto
```

The visual editor includes a **Theme** dropdown for this setting.

## Visual Editor

RadarWise includes a Home Assistant visual editor. When adding the card from the dashboard editor, you can:

- Choose a Home Assistant weather entity
- Choose an optional local temperature sensor when the weather entity is not local enough
- Choose an optional humidity sensor when the weather entity does not expose humidity
- Choose an optional dew point sensor when the weather entity does not expose dew point
- Choose an optional UV index sensor when Home Assistant has one
- Choose optional AQI and pollen source: Home Assistant sensors, Open-Meteo, or disabled
- Choose United States, Canada, United Kingdom, or global/other setup
- Choose automatic radar, NOAA radar, RainViewer radar, or no radar
- Choose radar timeline, style, map style, and radar loop speed
- Set title, units, forecast counts, language, time format, font preset, and theme mode
- Choose card language: Auto, English, French, Spanish, German, or Portuguese
- Choose a layout preset with visual layout tiles
- Drag panels to reorder clock/timeline, current weather, and radar
- Adjust panel widths and choose when the card collapses to vertical layout
- Show or hide the forecast summary
- Show or hide the hourly/forecast list and daily forecast cards
- Enable optional auto-scroll for long forecast lists
- Enable or disable subtle weather animations
- Set radar latitude/longitude and zoom
- Show or hide the radar panel
- Show or hide map controls
- Show or hide radar playback controls
- Show or hide the US NWS warning overlay

## Hidden Debug Panel

For troubleshooting, RadarWise includes a YAML-only debug panel. It is hidden from normal users and is not exposed in the visual editor.

```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  panel: true
```

Remove it after testing.

## Support

RadarWise is free and has no telemetry, ads, popups, tracking pixels, or in-card donation prompts.

If RadarWise helps your dashboard, you can support development here:

[Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/thewillmiller)

Available for custom Home Assistant dashboards, Lovelace cards, and kiosk interfaces. I take 2-3 commissions/month, typically $300-600 depending on scope.

## Troubleshooting

### RadarWise does not show in the card picker

1. Confirm RadarWise is installed in HACS.
2. Confirm the loaded resource points to `/hacsfiles/.../radarwise-card.js` or the compatibility `/hacsfiles/.../weatherwise-card.js`.
3. Hard-refresh the browser.
4. Restart Home Assistant if needed.
5. Check that the dashboard resource exists.
6. Open the browser console and look for RadarWise errors.

### Forecast data unavailable

1. Verify the selected weather entity exists.
2. Confirm the entity supports Home Assistant forecast data.
3. Try another `weather` entity.
4. Check the browser console for forecast service errors.

### Radar unavailable

1. Check the selected radar provider.
2. Use `radar_provider: noaa` only for US radar.
3. Use `radar_provider: envcanada` for Canada, or `radar_provider: rainviewer` for UK and global setups.
4. Confirm the dashboard browser can reach external map/radar tile services.

### What is the red dot on the radar?

The red radar dot appears when the US NWS warning overlay finds an active alert near the radar location. Click or tap the red dot for the alert headline. The small dark dot is the configured radar center.

### Humidity shows `--%`

1. Check whether the selected weather entity exposes a humidity attribute.
2. If it does not, choose a humidity sensor in the visual editor.
3. Or set `humidity_entity: sensor.your_humidity_sensor` in YAML.

### Dew point shows `--`

1. Check whether the selected weather entity exposes a dew point attribute.
2. If it does not, choose a dew point sensor in the visual editor.
3. Or set `dew_point_entity: sensor.your_dew_point_sensor` in YAML.

### AQI or pollen does not show

1. In the visual editor, open **Environment sensors**.
2. Choose **Open-Meteo, no API key** if you want RadarWise to fetch AQI, UV index, and pollen by latitude/longitude.
3. Or keep **Home Assistant sensors** and choose `air_quality_entity`, `pollen_entity`, `tree_pollen_entity`, `grass_pollen_entity`, `weed_pollen_entity`, or `mold_pollen_entity`.
4. Confirm `show_environment` is enabled.
5. Open-Meteo provides AQI, UV index, and pollen, but not mold. Mold requires a Home Assistant sensor.

### UV index does not show

1. Choose **Open-Meteo, no API key** under **Environment sensors**, or select a UV index sensor.
2. Confirm the radar latitude/longitude is set if using Open-Meteo.
3. Hourly UV appears only for hourly forecast rows, not daily or twice-daily rows.

### What do the blue bars show?

The blue bars in the forecast list show relative temperature across the visible rows. Longer bars are warmer compared with the other rows currently shown. If your weather provider exposes precipitation probability or amount, RadarWise also shows that beside the bar.

## Address-Based Setup

RadarWise intentionally uses Home Assistant weather entities instead of direct address lookup. Address entry would require geocoding plus direct weather-provider calls from the browser, which adds privacy, API key, rate-limit, and regional-provider questions. A future RadarWise integration could offer address-based setup more cleanly by creating the right entities in Home Assistant.

## Privacy

RadarWise does not include telemetry, tracking pixels, external analytics, or phone-home behavior.

When radar is enabled, the browser viewing the dashboard loads map/radar tiles from the selected provider. If `environment_source: open_meteo` is enabled, the browser sends the configured latitude and longitude to Open-Meteo's public air quality and forecast APIs to request AQI, UV index, and pollen data. If `environment_source: sensors` is used, AQI, UV index, and pollen come only from your Home Assistant entities or selected weather provider data. The card does not send weather entity data to a RadarWise server.

## Safety

RadarWise is informational. It is not a life-safety, severe-weather warning, aviation, boating, or emergency tool.

Always check official local forecasts, warnings, alerts, and emergency information for safety-critical decisions.

## Development

The distributable card is:

```text
radarwise-card.js
```

Run the local syntax check before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run check
```

For HACS default repository submission, RadarWise is a dashboard/custom card. HACS validation/submission uses the `plugin` category internally for dashboard plugins.
