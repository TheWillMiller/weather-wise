**Latest release:** `v0.3.1`

WeatherWise is a Home Assistant dashboard (Lovelace) custom card for current weather, hourly and daily forecasts, sunrise and sunset, wind, humidity, and optional radar. It follows the TideWise/RiverWise visual language while staying a dashboard card, not a backend integration.

> **Public release note:** WeatherWise is ready for regular use, but weather providers vary by region. Please report provider-specific layout, radar, or forecast quirks so support can keep improving.

## Region Support

WeatherWise gets weather data from an existing Home Assistant `weather` entity, so it can work anywhere Home Assistant has a weather provider.

| Region | Weather data | Radar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| United States | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | NOAA radar by default, RainViewer optional |
| Canada | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | RainViewer global radar by default |
| United Kingdom | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | RainViewer global radar by default |
| Global / other | Any Home Assistant `weather` entity | RainViewer global radar by default |

WeatherWise does not ask for, store, or call private weather API keys from dashboard YAML.

RainViewer is used only as a no-key global radar option. Its public API is for personal, educational, and small community use and may have service or coverage limits.

Canada currently uses RainViewer for radar. Native Environment Canada radar is not bundled yet; please open a feature request with the province/region and desired radar layer if you want to help shape that support.

### Testing Outside the US, Canada, and UK

WeatherWise should still render current conditions and forecasts anywhere Home Assistant has a working `weather` entity. Outside the initial US, Canada, and UK presets, radar falls back to RainViewer and local alert/warning overlays may be limited or unavailable.

If you are testing from Australia, New Zealand, Europe, or any other region, please open a report or feature request with:

- Country/region and nearest city or general area
- Home Assistant weather integration/provider
- Whether hourly and daily forecasts appear
- Whether RainViewer radar loads for your area
- Any local radar, warning, or forecast provider WeatherWise should know about

## Installation

### Recommended: HACS Custom Repository

[![Open WeatherWise in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=TheWillMiller&repository=weather-wise&category=plugin)

WeatherWise is not yet listed in the default/searchable HACS store. Until it is accepted into the default HACS list, install it as a custom HACS repository.

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Open the three-dot menu in the top right.
3. Choose **Custom repositories**.
4. Add this repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/TheWillMiller/weather-wise
```

5. For category, choose **Dashboard**.
6. Install **WeatherWise**.
7. Refresh Home Assistant.

A hard browser refresh is recommended after installing or updating:

- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

Then add the card from your dashboard editor:

1. Edit your dashboard.
2. Add a new card.
3. Search for **WeatherWise**.
4. Open the visual editor.
5. Choose a weather entity.
6. Choose the region/radar setup.
7. Save.

### Manual Install

1. Download or copy `weatherwise-card.js`.
2. Place it in your Home Assistant `www` directory.
3. Add it as a dashboard resource:

```yaml
url: /local/weatherwise-card.js
type: module
```

4. Refresh Home Assistant and hard-refresh your browser.
5. Add the card to a dashboard.

### Test From GitHub CDN

For quick testing before installing locally, you can add this dashboard resource:

```yaml
url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheWillMiller/weather-wise@v0.3.1/weatherwise-card.js
type: module
```

CDN testing is not the preferred long-term install method. HACS is recommended for normal use.

## Quick Start

```yaml
type: custom:weatherwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: us
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: weatherwise
units: auto
latitude: 33.688
longitude: -78.886
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## Canada Example

```yaml
type: custom:weatherwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: ca
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: weatherwise
units: metric
latitude: 43.6532
longitude: -79.3832
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## UK Example

```yaml
type: custom:weatherwise-card
entity: weather.home
title: Local Weather
country: uk
radar_provider: auto
theme_mode: auto
units: metric
latitude: 51.5072
longitude: -0.1276
grid_options:
  rows: full
  columns: 18
```

## Theme Support

WeatherWise defaults to its built-in glass styling:

```yaml
theme_mode: weatherwise
```

To make the card follow Home Assistant theme colors more closely, use:

```yaml
theme_mode: auto
```

The visual editor includes a **Theme** dropdown for this setting.

## Visual Editor

WeatherWise includes a Home Assistant visual editor. When adding the card from the dashboard editor, you can:

- Choose a Home Assistant weather entity
- Choose an optional humidity sensor when the weather entity does not expose humidity
- Choose United States, Canada, United Kingdom, or global/other setup
- Choose automatic radar, NOAA radar, RainViewer radar, or no radar
- Choose radar timeline, style, map style, and radar loop speed
- Set title, units, layout, forecast counts, and theme mode
- Show or hide the hourly/forecast list and daily forecast cards
- Enable or disable subtle weather animations
- Set radar latitude/longitude and zoom
- Show or hide the radar panel
- Show or hide map controls
- Show or hide radar playback controls
- Show or hide the US NWS warning overlay

## Configuration

## Hidden Debug Panel

For troubleshooting, WeatherWise includes a YAML-only debug panel. It is hidden from normal users and is not exposed in the visual editor.

```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  panel: true
```

Remove it after testing.

## Support

WeatherWise is free and has no telemetry, ads, popups, tracking pixels, or in-card donation prompts.

## Troubleshooting

### WeatherWise does not show in the card picker

1. Confirm WeatherWise is installed in HACS.
2. Hard-refresh the browser.
3. Restart Home Assistant if needed.
4. Check that the dashboard resource exists.
5. Open the browser console and look for WeatherWise errors.

### Forecast data unavailable

1. Verify the selected weather entity exists.
2. Confirm the entity supports Home Assistant forecast data.
3. Try another `weather` entity.
4. Check the browser console for forecast service errors.

### Radar unavailable

1. Check the selected radar provider.
2. Use `radar_provider: noaa` only for US radar.
3. Use `radar_provider: rainviewer` for Canada, UK, and global setups.
4. Confirm the dashboard browser can reach external map/radar tile services.

### Humidity shows `--%`

1. Check whether the selected weather entity exposes a humidity attribute.
2. If it does not, choose a humidity sensor in the visual editor.
3. Or set `humidity_entity: sensor.your_humidity_sensor` in YAML.

## Address-Based Setup

WeatherWise intentionally uses Home Assistant weather entities instead of direct address lookup. Address entry would require geocoding plus direct weather-provider calls from the browser, which adds privacy, API key, rate-limit, and regional-provider questions. A future WeatherWise integration could offer address-based setup more cleanly by creating the right entities in Home Assistant.

## Privacy

WeatherWise does not include telemetry, tracking pixels, external analytics, or phone-home behavior.

When radar is enabled, the browser viewing the dashboard loads map/radar tiles from the selected provider. The card does not send weather entity data to a WeatherWise server.

## Safety

WeatherWise is informational. It is not a life-safety, severe-weather warning, aviation, boating, or emergency tool.

Always check official local forecasts, warnings, alerts, and emergency information for safety-critical decisions.

## License

## Development

The distributable card is:

```text
weatherwise-card.js
```

Run the local syntax check before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run check
```

For HACS default repository submission, WeatherWise is a dashboard/custom card. HACS validation/submission uses the `plugin` category internally for dashboard plugins.
