# Changelog

## 0.8.2

### Added

- Added a `time_format` option with Auto, 12-hour, and 24-hour choices for the main clock, hourly rows, radar loop labels, update timestamps, and sunrise/sunset times.
- Added a safe `font_family` preset selector using local/system font stacks only. No remote fonts or external font assets are loaded.

## 0.8.1

### Fixed

- Added forecast-data fallbacks for humidity and dew point when a weather provider omits those values from the current weather entity but includes them in forecast payloads.
- Moved the debug panel out of the squeezed center weather column so it opens as a readable full-width troubleshooting panel.
- Expanded debug output with resolved humidity/dew point sources, raw weather attributes, and sample forecast keys.

## 0.8.0

### Added

- Added smart content focus presets: full dashboard, essentials, forecast only, hourly only, radar only, and custom.
- Added a Density control with Comfortable, Slim, and Large sizing presets.
- Added single-panel rendering so forecast-only, hourly-only, and radar-only cards use the full card space cleanly.
- Added a basemap tile-error fallback so RadarWise can recover if a map tile provider rejects requests.

### Changed

- The Street map basemap now uses CARTO-hosted Voyager tiles with OpenStreetMap attribution instead of calling the volunteer `tile.openstreetmap.org` endpoint directly.
- Selecting the Full content preset in the visual editor now restores the main clock, forecast, environment, and radar panels.
- Changing an individual visibility switch in the visual editor now automatically moves the card to Custom content mode.

## 0.7.2

### Added

- Added high/low temperature ranges to daily forecast cards when the weather provider exposes a low temperature.
- Added a multi-alert NWS popup so tapping the radar alert pill shows every active alert, not only the first one.

### Fixed

- Fixed plural wording on the NWS alert pill.

## 0.7.1

### Added

- Added optional UV index support beside the current condition.
- Added hourly UV values when hourly forecast data or Open-Meteo provides them.
- Added a visual editor picker for a Home Assistant UV index sensor.
- Added Open-Meteo UV loading through the no-key Forecast API when Open-Meteo is selected.

### Fixed

- When Open-Meteo reports all pollen categories as zero, RadarWise now shows general Pollen instead of labeling Tree Pollen as the dominant source.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- Added optional Open-Meteo AQI and pollen support with no API key.
- Added an Environment source selector in the visual editor: Home Assistant sensors, Open-Meteo, or Disabled.
- Added hourly-cached AQI/pollen loading by the configured radar latitude/longitude.
- Added debug panel rows for environment source, last environment update, and fetch errors.

### Changed

- Kept Home Assistant sensors as the default AQI/pollen source for privacy-first installs.
- Updated README, HACS info, and troubleshooting notes for Open-Meteo mode and its latitude/longitude request.

## 0.6.0

### Added

- Added optional AQI and pollen support using existing Home Assistant sensors or helpers.
- Added visual editor selectors for air quality, general pollen, tree pollen, grass pollen, weed pollen, and mold sensors.
- Added a compact environment cluster beside the clock/date so AQI and pollen can appear above the hourly forecast list without crowding the main weather stats.
- Added localized AQI and pollen labels/severity text for the supported card languages.

### Changed

- Kept AQI and pollen entity-driven only. RadarWise does not call outside air quality or pollen APIs.
- Updated release docs, configuration notes, and tester prompts for `v0.6.0`.

## 0.5.1

### Fixed

- Restored `weatherwise-card.js` as a compatibility loader so existing HACS/manual resources keep loading RadarWise after the rename.
- Updated the frontend check workflow to validate both the new RadarWise file and the compatibility loader.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Added dew point support as a fifth detail tile beside humidity, wind, sunrise, and sunset.
- Added automatic dew point detection from common weather entity attributes.
- Added optional `dew_point_entity` support and a visual editor picker for dedicated dew point sensors.

### Changed

- Renamed the project, card picker entry, HACS metadata, install filename, docs, and examples to RadarWise.
- Changed the primary card type to `custom:radarwise-card` and the install file to `radarwise-card.js`.
- Kept the previous custom card element names registered as hidden runtime aliases so existing dashboards keep rendering during the rename transition.

## 0.3.6

### Added

- Added an optional playful forecast summary ticker under the date.
- Added a visual editor toggle and YAML option: `show_forecast_summary`.

- Replaced active beta wording with public-release support language.

### Notes

- Existing `v0.2.0-beta.*` releases remain in the changelog for history.
- RadarWise still welcomes provider and region reports, especially for non-US radar and forecast behavior.

## 0.2.0-beta.11

### Changed

- `wide_panel` layout now forces a denser horizontal layout for wider dashboard cards.
- Stacked and narrow layouts now place clock/date first, current weather and daily forecast second, and the forecast list below.
- Auto layout now waits until a narrower container before switching out of the horizontal dashboard layout.

### Fixed

- Added twice-daily and daily fallback content for providers that do not expose hourly forecasts.
- Added radar resize observation so the map can recover after Home Assistant edit/save layout changes without requiring a manual refresh.

## 0.2.0-beta.10

### Added

- Added a `layout` option with `auto`, `wide_panel`, `stacked`, and `compact` modes.
- Added the layout selector to the visual editor.

### Fixed

- Improved Home Assistant Sections dashboard behavior by increasing default grid height and adding safer stacked/compact layouts.
- Fixed radar initialization when multiple RadarWise cards or editor previews load Leaflet at the same time.
- Added more radar size retries after dashboard save/reload so the map is less likely to stay blank.
- Allowed hourly rows to stretch to fill available height when only a few rows are shown.
- Reduced current-temperature clipping risk in short landscape cards.

## 0.2.0-beta.9

### Fixed

- Fixed Home Assistant visual editor dropdowns closing immediately in Chrome by avoiding unnecessary editor re-renders while entity data is unchanged.

## 0.2.0-beta.8

### Added

- Added subtle built-in weather icon animations for sun, moon, clouds, rain, snow, fog, and thunder conditions.
- Added a visual editor toggle and YAML option to disable animations with `show_animations: false`.

### Changed

- Improved wall-panel readability by increasing date, forecast, hourly, and stat text sizes.
- Enlarged forecast cards and stat rows to use vertical space more effectively in the wide-panel layout.

## 0.2.0-beta.5

### Fixed

- Filtered the humidity entity picker so battery, ink, vacuum brush lifespan, and other generic percent sensors are no longer offered as humidity choices.
- Ignored already-configured humidity fallback entities unless they actually look like humidity sensors.
- Normalized stale current `*-night` weather states to daytime display conditions when `sun.sun` is above the horizon.

## 0.2.0-beta.4

### Changed

- Removed the visible left-column title/region header from the rendered card for a cleaner wide-panel look.

### Fixed

- Fixed `clear-night` and night partly-cloudy conditions rendering with daytime sun icons.

- Recreated and cleaned up card timers correctly across dashboard add/remove cycles.
- Added repository checkout to the HACS validation workflow.
- Added GeoJSON accept headers for NWS alert requests while keeping the card frontend-only.
- Escaped Home Assistant entity names and editor values before rendering visual editor HTML.

### Changed

- Added a visual editor humidity entity picker.
- Added radar timeline modes: recent loop, current frame, and future if the provider exposes future frames.
- Added US NWS active warning overlay support.
- Added a visual editor toggle for the warning overlay.

### Changed

- NOAA future radar now falls back to the current radar frame because the NOAA radar image service used by RadarWise is observed/current radar.

## 0.2.0-beta.1

### Added

- Added radar playback controls for pause/play, previous frame, and next frame.
- Added radar style options: standard, high contrast, and soft.

## 0.1.0-beta.4

### Fixed

- Fixed Leaflet radar rendering inside the RadarWise shadow DOM by embedding the required Leaflet layout styles in the card.
- Restored wide-card proportions to more closely match the original RadarWise HTML dashboard.
- Kept radar as a true right-side panel on wide dashboards instead of switching too early to a bottom row.
- Tuned daily forecast, center, and left-column spacing to better match the original RadarWise card.

## 0.1.0-beta.3

### Fixed

- Fixed auto-height dashboards growing the RadarWise card far beyond the intended height.
- Added explicit grid sizing defaults for Home Assistant section dashboards.
- Reworked card height so the desktop/tablet layout is bounded while narrow/mobile cards can still stack naturally.
- Removed large Leaflet map minimum heights that could inflate dashboard layout.
- Delayed radar initialization until the map container has a real rendered size.
- Added additional Leaflet size invalidation passes so radar tiles stay visible after Home Assistant layout changes.

## 0.1.0-beta.2

### Fixed

- Fixed the visual editor/card picker script failure caused by registering the same custom element class under two tag names.
- Added a clearer card picker name: **RadarWise Weather**.
- Improved dashboard-column layout by using card/container width breakpoints instead of only viewport width.
- Fixed narrow card overflow when radar is hidden or the card is placed in a smaller dashboard column.

## 0.1.0-beta.1
